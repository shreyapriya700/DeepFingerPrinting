Deep Fingerprinting: Undermining Website Fingerprinting Defenses with Deep Learning

Implemented a deep learning model using CNN to carry out web fingerprinting attack against defended and non defended websites.
We propose Deep Fingerprinting (DF), a new WF attack based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed using cutting-edge DL methods. The attack uses a simple input format and does not require handcrafting features for classification
